## Welcome to GitHub Pages

IBM Cloud ObjectStorage is available under two APIs, S3 and Swift. The Swift deployment has been available for sometime in Softlayer / Bluemix and is deployed in a large number of data centers. The new S3 API is currently being rolled out across IBM Bluemix. In addition to the differences in API, the underlying storage technology is different. Thus containers/buckets and objects created via one API are not available via the other API. If you are looking to migrate from Swift and S3, these pages might help.
