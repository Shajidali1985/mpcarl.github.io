# Finding your IBM Cloud ObjectStorage access credentials
Don't know how to find your access credentials for IBM Cloud ObjectStorage (COS) S3 or Swift?


## IBM Cloud Object Storage (S3) API
The IBM Cloud ObjectStorage S3 API uses a combination of an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key to interact with your buckets. You will need these keys to manage your buckets.
You can find this information on the [Softlayer Customer Portal][sl] under the [Object Storage][slos] section. Select the Account name to get the details of the storage account. If you don't have an existing account with the API Type of S3, click the Order Object Storage link in the upper right corner.

Once you are on the details page of your COS S3 account, select the "Access & Permissions" link and expand the "Access Keys" section. Your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key will now be visible.
